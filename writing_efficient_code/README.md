# Writing Efficient Code
This folder in `python-notes` contains code and notes about writing efficient code. The basis of this section was the course on DataCamp; you can view all of the courses that I have taken on there by viewing my profile [here](datacamp.com/profile/willcanniford).  

The goal is write code that has the smallest runtime while minimising the memory usage.
