    "When programming you are using functions most of the time. You want to be able to package your code into easy-to-understand packets that you can use later without having to do complex processes. This is one way in which you can both increase the readability of your code, which is especially important when working with others, and decrease the amount of code that you write (DRY). <br>\n",
