## `matplotlib.pyplot`
A lot of the focus of this section of the repository is going to be about `matplotlib.pyplot` which is the module that focusses on the object-orientated approach to using `matplotlib`.

The official documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.3/contents.html). 

----

When you call `fig, axes = plt.subplots()` then you are creating two different objects. A `figure` object and an `axes` object; not to be confused with the axis of a plot itself. The `figure` object is a container that is going to hold everything that you see on the page, whereas the `axes` is the part of the page that holds the data.
