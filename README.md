# Python notes
This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks I have written and development while taking numerous online courses (see my [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/willcanniford) profile for a list of the courses I have taken there). I have grouped them into topics the best that I can but there is, undoubtedly, some overlap.  

I spend the majority of my time working on data projects and analysing datasets when I'm not working, if you want to see some of the data work that I have written up then I would check out my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/willcanniford) profile where I am a Kernels Expert.
