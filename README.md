# Python notes
This repository is just a collection of notebooks with code that I have written during my courses. I have tried to group the notebooks roughly into topics but there is, inevitably, some overlap. I spend the majority of my time working on data projects and analysing datasets when I'm not working, so this isn't representative of my python knowledge, but more what I have had time to write up. <br>
