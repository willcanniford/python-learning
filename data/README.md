## Craft cans 
This was found on Kaggle ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans)) and contains information about more than 2,000 craft beers made in the US. It contains a number of features, both categorical and numeric. It is split into a beers table, and a corresponding breweries table that can be joined using IDs.  
It is a nice dataset to work with and I have done an analysis on it, in R, that can be found on my Kaggle [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/willcanniford).
